### Use Case: Interoperable IFCB data product for the CA HAB Bulletin
### Target data product to standardize to Darwin Core:

(Time series of) concentration of 2 genera of HAB taxa from IFCB sample(s)

### Use Case Goals are 3-fold:

- Output an IFCB data product that is interoperable with other taxon-resolved HAB data product(s) in the CA HAB Bulletin (see CDPH and HABMAP in https://sccoos.org/california-hab-bulletin/december-2022/ )
- The data product will be an occurrence table that meets minimum requirements for OBIS
- The occurrence table will include additional columns following “Best practices and recommendations for plankton imaging data management” (http://dx.doi.org/10.25607/OBP-1742) to report provenance for automated identifications
